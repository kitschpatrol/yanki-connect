		 * inclusion of files with an MD5 hash that matches the provided value. This
		 * is useful for avoiding the saving of error pages and stub files. The
		 * `fields` member is a list of fields that should play audio or video, or
		 * show a picture when the card is displayed in Anki. The `allowDuplicate`
		 * member inside `options` group can be set to true to enable adding
		 * duplicate cards. Normally duplicate cards can not be added and trigger
		 * exception.

		 * The `duplicateScope` member inside `options` can be used to specify the
		 * scope for which duplicates are checked. A value of `"deck"` will only
		 * check for duplicates in the target deck; any other value will check the
		 * entire collection.
		 *
		 * The `duplicateScopeOptions` object can be used to specify some additional
		 * settings:
		 *
		 * - `duplicateScopeOptions.deckName` will specify which deck to use for
		 *   checking duplicates in. If undefined or null, the target deck will be
		 *   used.
		 * - `duplicateScopeOptions.checkChildren` will change whether or not
		 *   duplicate cards are checked in child decks. The default value is false.
		 * - `duplicateScopeOptions.checkAllModels` specifies whether duplicate
		 *   checks are performed across all note types. The default value is false.
